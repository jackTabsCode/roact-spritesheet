# Roact Spritesheet

This is a handy spritesheet component for Roact. It can easily be used with [Evaera's Radial Sprite Sheet generator](https://eryn.io/RadialSpriteSheetGenerator/), but works for general purpose spritesheets too.

## Installation

Use npm to install:

```bash
npm install @rbxts/roact-spritesheet
```

## Usage

Documentation is included inline. The Spritesheet component also accepts any props from the ImageLabel class.
